  caption="Meander Migration and Neck Cutoff is an example of River Behavior - not River Evolution. If this captured the change from a meandering river to a braided river, that would be an example of evolution."

 River evolution is the term Fryirs and Brierley use to describe the long term trajectory of "change" of routine river adjustments (i.e. normal behavior) within a riverscape. When such changes to behavior are pronounced enough, there is a change from river style  from one flavor to another (e.g. a single thread meandering river to a braided river). Such changes are typically due to a change in flux boundary conditions and these can be driven by changes in climate, tectonics and geologic forcing, and or anthropogenic changes (e.g. [Chapter 13](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.dist.lib.usu.edu/lib/usu/reader.action?docID=1032536&ppg=285)). 

### [Learning Outcomes](../syllabus/#course-objectives)

- **LO 3**. Apply principles of geomorphic analysis to a diversity of riverscapes.
- **LO 4**. Gain an appreciation of how geomorphic processes of erosion, deposition transport and storage of sediment shape topography and create, maintain, sculpt and destroy distinctive landforms.
