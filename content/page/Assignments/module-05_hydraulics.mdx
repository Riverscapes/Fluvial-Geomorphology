# Module 5 Field Observations: Hydraulics

<Button to="/Course_Topics/module-05" title="See Corresponding Learning Module" fullWidth color="secondary" iconName="AutoStories" />



## The Assignment

Go to a local stream or river with flowing water (please do not get in the water for safety purposes). Build as web page with the following:

1. Provide a Location Map
2. Provide a Field Map Sketch (Planform) – Denote on it where you record remaining observations ( 3 through 6)
3. Take some oblique photos of the channel and annotate: 
    1. Arrows representing flow direction (magnitude by length)
    2. Find examples of:
       1. Convergent flow
       2. Divergent flow
       3. Uniform flow 
    3. Flow Separation, Flow Seam, Reattachment Zone, Shear Zone Type (Eddy vs. Wake)
    4. Use Table 5.1 to identify surface flow-types you see present
4. Estimate the discharge in the channel (what is average depth? What is average velocity (use orange peel method)? What is flow width? Q=VA)
5. Draw a rough cross section (use approximate scale, no –need to wade in channel) 
6. Find at least one example of a hydraulic jump. Record video and identify :
   2. The upstream subcritical flow
   3. The transition to supercritical flow
   4. The hydraulic jump itself
   5. The downstream subcritical flow

## Cool Examples

It is helpful to get inspiration from others and borrow ideas to apply to your observations, websites and reading of your own riverscapes!

### From 2021

The [2021 class](/Fluvial-Geomorphology/syllabus/2021_Spring.html#2021-cohort) had some really good  assignment. Some of the most inspiring examples are in the table below and some excerpts are stolen from each:
