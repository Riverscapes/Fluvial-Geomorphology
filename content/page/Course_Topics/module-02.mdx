## Background & why we're covering it

 [Chapter 2 on  'Key concepts in river geomorphology'](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.dist.lib.usu.edu/lib/usu/reader.action?docID=1032536&ppg=25) will:
 - Elaborate on the hierarchal spatial scales we introduced in Chapter 1
 - Introduce temporal scale constructs  in evaluating riverscapes
 - Introduce some common concepts used by geomorphologists in making spatio-temporal interpretations of these dynamic systems

We will make reference to many of these concepts throughout the course and it will be assumed you are clear on these foundational concepts. 

### [Learning Outcomes](/syllabus/#course-objectives)

1. Differentiate influence of external controls (e.g. climate and catchment) vs. local controls on form and process. 
3. Apply principles of geomorphic analysis to a diversity of riverscapes.
3. Recognize the primary controls on riverscape diversity, in which distinctive suites of physical and biotic processes (behavior) help shape the form and character of those landscapes.
