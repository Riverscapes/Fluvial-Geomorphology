Welcome to the Fluvial Geomorphology Course Website!

This online resource is designed primarily for students enrolled in the introductory fluvial geomorphology courses, including [WATS 5150/6150](/syllabus/), [GEO 5150/6150](/syllabus/), and [CEWA 6150](/syllabus/) taught through [Utah State University](https://qcnr.usu.edu/wats/). However, it also serves as a valuable introduction to the fascinating field of fluvial geomorphology and will build an appreciation of riverscapes for students and practitioners seeking knowledge in this area.
