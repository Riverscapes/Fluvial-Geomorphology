# Module 4 Field Notebook: Hydrology Bingo

<Button to="/Course_Topics/module-04" title="See Corresponding Learning Module" fullWidth color="secondary" iconName="AutoStories" />


## The Assignment

Get your field notebook page on your website setup and at least two processes observed. In setting it up, you need to commit to (and stick with the whole semester) one bingo card. The real assignment will run all semester long. You need to get "Bingo" by the end of the semester. The first three to declare Bingo (and not have their results contested) will get a prize and a Grand Prize will go to the first Full Card winner.

## The Rules
In normal Bingo you all get different bingo cards. Here, you have four  bingo cards to choose from below. Your job is to get Bingo by one of the following winning patterns:

The way you record your processes will be as follows:
Show on your web page, which bingo cell you are reporting. Keep a running list of all cells below as sub-heading sub-sections in which you:
- denote the process you are reporting
- provide a one sentence definition of process
- show us the process (preferably a video narrated) in action (or a very well annotated photo or series of photos) from your own local field observations.
- explain why you think it is that process

Your observations must be your own (no re-using of other's YouTube videos.. though you can use them for inspiration). You need to observe these processes in the field.

## The Bingo Cards

All have the same mix of processes... just in different orders. Choose one and stick to it.

#### Worth a Look
Just cool examples:
- [Casey's site](https://cchoate2.wixsite.com/fluvial/field-notebook-copy) is well worth a look.
- [Haley](https://sites.google.com/aggiemail.usu.edu/hcanham-fluvial/home/module-4) got a double bingo and had a great sheet flow example. -
- [Amy](https://sites.google.com/aggiemail.usu.edu/fluv/projects/hydrology-bingo) did a really exemplar job explaining the hydrologic processes in each of her videos as well as defining them in the videos. -
- [Daniel](https://danielthurber.weebly.com/fluvial-geomorphology/hydrology-bingo) and [Jeff](https://sites.google.com/view/jeffreycgeomorphology/projectsassingmnets/bingo-assignment?authuser=0) both have a ton of the bingo card populated with links to  videos. Daniel's explanations and definitions are exceptionally clear and useful. I was particularly impressed by the coffee infiltration (I think Daniel could be one of those professional narrators or book on tape readers):

- [Lauren](https://sites.google.com/aggiemail.usu.edu/lauren-herbine-fluvgeomorph/field-notebook/hydrology-bingo?authuser=0) has some really fun examples and nice stories to go along with each. -
- [Denny's](https://fluvialhaynes.weebly.com/hydrology-bingo.html) definitions were a really helpful way to present these. -
- [Shelby's](https://sites.google.com/view/shelbysawyer/projects-assignments/bingo) snow accumlation time-lapse is a [PBR](http://lowtechpbr.restoration.usu.edu) soft spot for me.
- [Kat](https://sites.google.com/view/kat-sd/projectsassignments/assignment-3-hydrologic-processes?authuser=0), like Daniel, had some wonderfully clear explanations and defintions. I was particularlly impressed by her multi-tasking (I think she did this [condensation](https://sites.google.com/view/kat-sd/projectsassignments/assignment-3-hydrologic-processes/condensation?authuser=0) and [snow accumulation](https://sites.google.com/view/kat-sd/projectsassignments/assignment-3-hydrologic-processes/snow?authuser=0) videos while walking to class)! Impressive.

- [Anna](https://geology3a.weebly.com/hydrology-bingo.html) provided a really clear list of defintions and log of her observed processes.
