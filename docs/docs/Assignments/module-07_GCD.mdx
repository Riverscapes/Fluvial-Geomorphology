## The Set-Up
![The River Feshie, Scotland, UK](/images/assignments/jgrf20060-fig-0002-m.png)
We will take you to the Highlands of Scotland, to the River Feshie to help you become familiar with quantitative analysis of channel geometry changes (the subject of Chapter 6). In the figure at right from Wheaton et al. ([2013](http://doi.org/10.1002/jgrf.20060)) we can see a braided gravel bed river actively adjusting through time. You will be given access to topographic surveys from 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 of this reach. 

In the [book](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/usu/reader.action?docID=1032536&ppg=131&c=RVBVQg), your authors talk about bed and bank processes that influence channel shape. You will zoom in and look directly at such changes to a real river, and use a tool, the [Geomorphic Change Detection Software](http://gcd.riverscapes.net) to analyze it quantitatively. 

## Purpose
The goals of this assignment is to i) give you experience working with topographic datasets (that capture channel geometry), and ii) help you recognize and identify specific mechanisms of geomorphic change from repeat topographic datasets. These concepts were cast in [Chapter 7 as "Channel Geometry"](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.dist.lib.usu.edu/lib/usu/reader.action?docID=1032536&ppg=132) changes and here we will unpack that a little more with topographic analysis. 

----------------
## Prerequisites
Students/Participants are expected to have some previous GIS experience and some understanding of topographic data and digital elevation models.

:::info
There is a [GCD Add-In](https://gcd.riverscapes.net/Download/) for ESRI ArcMap, however, because ArcMap is deprecated, we will do this exercise using a [standalone version](https://gcd.riverscapes.net/Download/) of the GCD software. The standalone version lacks the built in map display provided by the add-in, however, it has all the same analysis capabilities, and the outputs can be visualized in QGIS or ArcPro.

## The Assignment

### Part 1 - Build Project & Do Some Budget Segregation

:::note
The videos below are a bit dated and demonstrate the ArcMap Add-In version of GCD. However, the workflows are the same in the standalone GCD software.
:::

For the first part of this assignment, I want you to do:
- 1.A Download the [Feshie Data](http://gcd.riverscapes.net/Tutorials/example-data-sets) (also below)
- 1. B Create a [GCD Project](http://gcd.riverscapes.net/Concepts/projects) (you will bring this to class on Monday and turn this in for Part 2) with at least:
  -  1.B.1: Three of the Five years loaded as surveys (see videos for how to do error modelling)
  - 1.B.2: Two change detections (threshold @ 80% probability) for two of the epochs 
  - 1.B.3: A budget segregation with at least two examples each of the following mechanisms of change identified:
    - Bank Erosion 
    - Channel Bed Lowering (degradation / incision)
    - Channel Bed Rising (aggradation)
    - Bar Development 

As you work through this, post any questions and/or problems you encounter, or any potentially interesting findings to a class [Discussion](https://usu.instructure.com/courses/805010/discussion_topics).

#### Concepts to Illustrate & Explain

Building your GCD Project. In this tutorial, I show you how to get through 1.B.1 and 1.B.2 above.

For more information on budget segregation, see the following GCD Tutorials:
- [Basic Budget Segregation](http://gcd.riverscapes.net/Tutorials/GeomorphicInterpretation/simple-budget-segregation)
- [Morphodynamic Signatures from Budget Segregation](http://gcd.riverscapes.net/Tutorials/GeomorphicInterpretation/morphodynamic-signatures-from-budget-segeregation)


### Part 2 - Turn in a Web Page
You will prepare a web page explaining what you did and defending your interpretations. Please include clear annotated figure(s) and/or video showing the identification two examples each of these four mechanisms:

- Bank Erosion 
- Channel Bed Lowering (degradation / incision)
- Channel Bed Rising (aggradation)
- Bar Development 

If you opt not to use video, please instead describe with text what you interpreted and justify your interpretation.

### Relevant Paper
The work we will do on "budget segregation" is based on Wheaton et al. (2013):
- Wheaton JM, Brasington J, Darby SE, Sear DA, Vericat D‡., and Kasprak A. 2013.
