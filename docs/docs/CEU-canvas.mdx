### How do I access my course(s)?

All online courses registered through Utah State University are accessed via the [USU Canvas learning management system](https://usu.instructure.com/).


<ToolsWrapper
  cards={[{
    title: "Canvas Login",
    description: "Access courses you are registered for through USU Canvas.",
    toolUrl: "https://usu.instructure.com/",

  }  
  ]}
/>

### I registred for CEU Credit through USU, but never got an email
By default, USU sends enrollment confirmation emails to your assigned university email address, which is your **A-Number@usu.edu**.


### What is my A-Number
Your A-Number is your unique USU student ID. It begins with the letter **A** followed by numbers (e.g., A01234567). You will need it to log in to Canvas and access course materials.

  }  
  ]}
/>

### How do I change my Canvas notification email?
USU assigns your default Canvas email as **A-Number@usu.edu**, but you can add or change notification emails.

Follow [these instructions](https://community.instructure.com/en/kb/articles/662889-how-do-i-change-my-default-email-address-in-my-user-account).

### Canvas notifications

We recommend [adjusting your Canvas notification settings](https://community.instructure.com/en/kb/articles/662894-how-do-i-manage-my-canvas-notification-settings) to ensure you receive timely updates about announcements, due dates, and course activity.

## How the Online Class is Delivered

This class is an online, asynchronous class. That means that participants are free to move through the content at their own pace. It is set up to cover approximately one module per week, and there are assignment due dates designed to keep you roughly on track. However, you can move faster or slower as your schedule allows.

### Resources
Lectures and associated slides are posted in each Module.


### Help and support
If you have not signed up for the [Riverscapes Community Platform](https://www.riverscapes.net), we encourage you to do so. This allows you to connect with current and former students, as well as plug in to the wider world of riverscapes. For most questions, please post to the [Community Forum](https://www.riverscapes.net/topics/38136/forum). Many questions are shared, and responses benefit everyone. The instructor (and TA if we have one) actively monitor the forum.

If your question is private or course-specific, contact the instructor via Canvas messaging. For technical issues related to Riverscapes Consortium software, visit [Support](https://riverscapes.freshdesk.com/support/home).
