## Background and why we're covering it

This introductory chapter introduces the organizing framework for how we will approach studying fluvial geomorphology - geomorphic analysis. Another phrase for geomorphic analysis is *reading the landscape, and in our case of fluvial geomorphic analysis, we will focus on *reading riverscapes*. 

### [Learning Outcomes](/syllabus/#course-objectives)

- **LO 1**. Confidently *read* any riverscape and be able to map its core characteristics.
