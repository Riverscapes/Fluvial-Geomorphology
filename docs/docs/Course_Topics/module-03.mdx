## Background and why we're covering it

The fourth step in reading riverscapes involves placing your riverscape in its catchment context. Mapping, recognizing and quantifying with simple morphometrics (i.e. measurements of morphology) is a big part of this. 

### [Learning Outcomes](/syllabus/#course-objectives)

- **LO 1**. Differentiate influence of external controls (e.g., climate and catchment) vs. local controls on form and process. 
- **LO 4**. Recognize the primary controls on riverscape diversity, in which distinctive suites of physical and biotic processes (behavior) help shape the form and character of those landscapes.
