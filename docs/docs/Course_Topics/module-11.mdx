# Background and why we're covering it

This chapter focuses on characterizing what the normal range of adjustments from geomorphic processes, and how distinct river styles have a characteristic suite of such mechanisms of adjustments (e.g. avulsions, incision, thalweg shift, bar development, lateral migration, etc.). Following on from a chapter recognizing the diversity of river types (styles), we now have a basis for developing expectations about both the form (character) and processes (behavior) shaping a riverscape.


### [Learning Outcomes](/syllabus/#course-objectives)

- **LO 3**. Apply principles of geomorphic analysis to a diversity of riverscapes.
- **LO 7**. Gain an appreciation of how geomorphic processes of erosion, deposition transport and storage of sediment shape topography and create, maintain, sculpt and destroy distinctive landforms.
