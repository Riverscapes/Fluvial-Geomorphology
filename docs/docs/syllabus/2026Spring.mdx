## Registration 
We offer Fluvial Geomorphology for both Continuing Education Units (CEU) & USU academic credit. USU students should register for WATS 6900. Non-USU students and professionals taking the class for CEU should register for CEWA 6900 - Fluvial Geomorphology.  

:::note
The in-person Fluvial Geomorphology class for residential graduate and undergraduate students ([WATS/GEO 5150 / 6150](https://catalog.usu.edu/courses/WATS5150)) is being moved from a Spring offering to a fall offering. That class *will not* be offered in Spring 2026, but will be taught by Dr. Julie Scarmado starting Fall 2026. This online Fluvial Geomorphology - Reading Riverscapes Class is an online only course we plan to offer each spring. Matriculated on-campus students are recommended to take the in-person class when it is offered in the fall, but can substitute with this class.
