This course focuses on an introduction to fluvial geomorphology through teaching students to read landscapes and [riverscapes](https://riverscapes.net). Students will develop an appreciation of riverscape diversity, in which distinctive suites of physical and biotic processes (behavior) help shape the form and character of those landscapes.

## Course Objectives

![People in Stream](/images/pics/PeopleInStream.jfif)

This is an introductory course in fluvial geomorphology. Geomorphology is the study of landforms and processes that shape them. Fluvial geomorphology is a sub-discipline that focuses on *fluvial* processes (i.e., shaped by water) and landforms. We call the part of the landscape in which fluvial processes dominate, riverscapes. 

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
|  | Learning Outcome |
| :---- | :---------------- |
| **LO 1**. | Confidently *read* any riverscape and be able to map its core characteristics. |
| **LO 2**. | Differentiate influence of external controls (e.g., climate and catchment) vs. local controls on form and process. |
| **LO 3**. | Apply principles of geomorphic analysis to a diversity of riverscapes.|
| **LO 4**. | Recognize the primary controls on riverscape diversity, in which distinctive suites of physical and biotic processes (behavior) help shape the form and character of those landscapes. |
| **LO 5**. | Understand how hydrologic processes, give rise to hydraulic processes, which in local riverscapes determine the rates, magnitudes  and occurece of fluvial geomorphic proceses. |
| **LO 6**. | Appreciate that topography is a quantitative record of landforms and apply morphometric analysis can be used to map and differentiate those landforms (i.e., geomorphic units). |
| **LO 7**. |Gain an appreciation of how geomorphic processes of erosion, deposition transport and storage of sediment shape topography and create, maintain, sculpt and destroy distinctive landforms. | 
| **LO 8**. |Understand human impacts on riverscapes and fluvial forces. |
| **LO 9**. | Recognize how geomorphic analysis is used in practice to help manage riverscapes. |
